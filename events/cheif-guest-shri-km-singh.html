                                        The programme was organised by Dr. Kumar Raka, Head of the Disaster Management Cell, Noida and was sponsored by 'Shuttle', as a part of their corporate social responsibility initiative.

                                        The Policy Perspectives Foundation (PPF) has been active in spreading awareness about how to cope with various natural and even manmade disasters and hazards. The Foundation had also organized a three-day School Safety Programme at Delhi Public School, Ludhiana earlier in May 2015.<br><br>

                                        Children who are the future of our nation are highly vulnerable to disaster impacts, especially those who are living in hazard prone environment. Many schools in India are located in vulnerable areas and unprepared to respond to emergencies. Creating a safe environment for the children in schools is the most important task. Natural disasters affect even more children, causing them to lose their homes, their families, their schools, and their access to adequate food, water and sanitation. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure the safety of children and provide them with a safe environment, in which they can blossom into good citizens. For this purpose, both structural, as well as non-structural interventions will be necessary. Structural interventions would include strict adherence to guidelines set up for school buildings, while non- structural ones would include educating the staff, teachers, and students about school safety measures in order to mitigate and prepare for a disaster. <br><br>

                                        The Foundation hopes that these initiatives will act as a guideline to the educational institutions, emergency officials, teachers, students and even the community at large to address the special and multi-faceted needs of children in the event of natural and manmade disasters. These initiatives aim to empower children through imparting knowledge about safety measures to make them responsible future members of a disaster resilient society. <br><br>
